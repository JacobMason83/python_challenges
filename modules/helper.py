# how to import core libraries 
# you can do it in the command line or just in the import statements at the top of the fileyour using 

def greeting(first, last):
    return f'Hello,{first} {last}'

# print(greeting('Jacob', 'Mason'))

# so go back to the the command line  and type import helper
# then type py import helper , and helper.greeting('Jacob', 'Mason')
# you also want to have modules on your system that you use alot or need to import instead of importing it from the package manager 
#creating a new file called main.py 
#python will look at the default set of paths, and look at all the 3rd party paths
